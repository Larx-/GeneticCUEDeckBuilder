Individual effects are described by following syntax, so I can parse them.
Categories always have exactly one info, except Condition can have any amount.

EXAMPLE:    {TriggerTime:PLAY;Target:CARDS_IN_HAND(SELF,NAME,Mjï¿½lnir)),Effect:POWER(+68);Duration:TURNS(0);Condition:PLAYED(SELF,NAME,Thor)},
            {TriggerTime:RETURN;Target:CARDS_REMAINING(OTHER);Effect:ENERGY(+3);Duration:TURNS(1)}

Usable parameters in some cases are:
    who   = SELF | OTHER | BOTH
    what  = ALBUM | COLLECTION | NAME | NAME_CONTAINS
    name  = string to search
    value = int value for power and energy
    turns = number of turns to wait, can be 0 for end of same turn

TriggerTime:
    START_GAME
    START_ROUND
    START_TURN
    DRAW
    PLAY
    RETURN
    END_TURN
    END_ROUND

Target:
    CARDS_IN_DECK(who(,what,name))
    CARDS_IN_HAND(who(,what,name))
    CARDS_IN_REMAINING(who(,what,name))
    PLAYER(who)

Effect:
    POWER(value)
    ENERGY(value)

Duration:
    RETURN
    END_ROUND
    END_TURN
    END_ROUND
    TIMER(value)
    PERMANENT

Condition:
    PLAYED(who,what,name)
