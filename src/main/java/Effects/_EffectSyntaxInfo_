Individual effects are described by following syntax, so I can parse them.
Categories always have exactly one info, except Condition can have any amount.

Usable parameters in some cases are:
    turns = number of turns to wait
    who = SELF | OTHER | BOTH
    what = ALBUM | COLLECTION | NAME | NAME_CONTAINS
    name = string to search


ON:
    START_GAME
    (START_ROUND)
    START_TURN
    DRAW
    PLAY
    RETURN
    (END_TURN)
    (END_ROUND)
    (TIMER(turns))

TARGET:
    CARD_THIS
    CARD(who,what,name)
    CARDS_ALL(who(,what,name))
    CARDS_HAND(who(,what,name))
    CARDS_REMAINING(who(,what,name))

CONDITION:
    PLAYED(who,what,name)
