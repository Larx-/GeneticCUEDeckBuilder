Individual effects are described by following syntax, so I can parse them.
Categories always have exactly one info, except Condition can have any amount.

Usable parameters in some cases are:
    Who       = SELF | OTHER | BOTH
    Where     = CARDS_IN_DECK | CARDS_IN_HAND | CARDS_REMAINING | CARDS_PLAYED
    What      = ALBUM | COLLECTION | NAME | NAME_CONTAINS || BASE_ENERGY | BASE_POWER | RARITY || RANDOM | THIS
    Rarity    = Cmmn | Rare | Epic | Lgnd | Fusn | Ult-Fusn | Myth
    CompareTo = string to search
    Value     = int value (or string if options are specified)

TriggerTime:
    START_GAME
    START_ROUND
    START
    DRAW
    PLAY
    RETURN

Target: // TODO: Add better description / examples
    Who, [ Where, [ What, [ CompareTo ] ] ]             // If rest is omitted, Who = Player, Where = All those cards, What = Special cases
    // Also additionally Rarity

Effect:
    ENERGY_PER_TURN (Value)
    POWER_PER_TURN (Value)
    ENERGY (Value)
    POWER (Value)
    BURN (Value)
    LOCK                                                // May not have the duration UNTIL_PLAYED
    POWER_FOR_EACH (Value, CountEach)                   // CountEach defines a full Target object with Who, Where, What, CompareTo, UpTo (integer) and PlayHistory (boolean)

Duration:
    END_TURN
    END_ROUND
    TIMER (Value)
    PERMANENT
    UNTIL_PLAYED

Conditions:
    AFTER_ROUND (Value)
    BEFORE_ROUND (Value)
    AFTER_TURN (Value)
    BEFORE_TURN (Value)
    PLAYED_WITH (Who, Where, What, CompareTo)
    PLAYED_BEFORE (Who, Where, What, CompareTo)
    ROUND_STATE (Value)                                 // Value = Win | EqWin | Equal | EqLoss | Loss
    TURN_STATE (Value)                                  // Value = Win | EqWin | Equal | EqLoss | Loss   NOTE: Only properly applicable on RETURN
    TURN_IN_ROUND (Value)
    ROUNDS_LOST (Value)                                 // Value can be precise number or number with > | >= | <= | <
    ROUNDS_WON (Value)                                  // Value can be precise number or number with > | >= | <= | <
    DECK_CONTAINS (Who, Where, What, CompareTo, Value)  // Value can be precise number or number with > | >= | <= | <

OFTEN USED SHORTCUTS:
    THIS:
        "'Target':{'Who':'SELF','Where':'CARDS_IN_HAND','What':'THIS'}," +
   POWER:
        "'Effect':{'Type':'POWER','Value':'~1~'}," +
   TIMER:
        "'Duration':{'Type':'TIMER','Value':'~1~'}," +
   OPPOSITE (Workaround):
        "'Target':{'Who':'OTHER','Where':'CARDS_PLAYED','What':'RANDOM','Value':'1'}," +
   ADJACENT (Workaround):
        "'Target':{'Who':'SELF','Where':'CARDS_PLAYED','What':'RANDOM','Value':'2'}," +
