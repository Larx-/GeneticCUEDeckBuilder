Individual effects are described by following syntax, so I can parse them.
Categories always have exactly one info, except Condition can have any amount.

Usable parameters in some cases are:
    Who       = SELF | OTHER | BOTH
    Where     = CARDS_IN_DECK | CARDS_IN_HAND | CARDS_REMAINING | CARDS_PLAYED
    What      = ALBUM | COLLECTION | NAME | NAME_CONTAINS || BASE_ENERGY | BASE_POWER | RARITY || RANDOM | THIS
    Rarity    = Cmmn | Rare | Epic | Lgnd | Fusn | Ult-Fusn | Myth
    CompareTo = string to search
    Value     = int value (or string if options are specified)

TriggerTime:
    START_GAME
    START_ROUND
    START
    DRAW
    PLAY
    RETURN

Target: // TODO: Add better description / examples
    Who, [ Where, [ What, [ CompareTo ] ] ]             // If rest is omitted, Who = Player, Where = All those cards, What = Special cases
    // Also additionally Rarity

Effect:
    ENERGY_PER_TURN (Value)
    POWER_PER_TURN (Value)
    ENERGY (Value)
    POWER (Value)
    BURN (Value)
    LOCK                                                // May not have the duration UNTIL_PLAYED
    POWER_FOR_EACH (Value, CountEach)                   // CountEach defines a full Target object with Who, Where, What, CompareTo, UpTo (integer) and PlayHistory (false for in deck, true for played this game)

Duration:
    END_TURN
    END_ROUND
    TIMER (Value)
    PERMANENT
    UNTIL_PLAYED

Conditions:
    AFTER_ROUND (Value)
    BEFORE_ROUND (Value)
    AFTER_TURN (Value)
    BEFORE_TURN (Value)
    PLAYED_WITH (Who, Where, What, CompareTo)
    PLAYED_BEFORE (Who, Where, What, CompareTo)
    ROUND_STATE (Value)                                 // Value = Win | EqWin | Equal | EqLoss | Loss // TODO: make >= available
    TURN_STATE (Value)                                  // Value = Win | EqWin | Equal | EqLoss | Loss   NOTE: Only properly applicable on RETURN
    TURN_IN_ROUND (Value)
    ROUNDS_LOST (Value)                                 // Value can be precise number or number with > | >= | <= | <
    ROUNDS_WON (Value)                                  // Value can be precise number or number with > | >= | <= | <
    DECK_CONTAINS (Who, Where, What, CompareTo, Value)  // Value can be precise number or number with > | >= | <= | <

REGEX for finding all card names containing " and "
.*\d\d\d\t.* and .*\t.*\t.*\t.*\t.*\t.*\t.*


// TODO: Formalize this into something like above...
NEW EXAMPLES HOW I WOULD LIKE TO APPROXIMATELY FORMAT THE EFFECTS USING REGEX:
(D.B. Cooper) When drawn, lock this card in your hand for the rest of the round.
              When played, for every Awesome Aviation card played this game by either player (up to a maximum of 18), give this card +10 Power this turn.
              When returned to your deck, give your Money, Money, Money cards, wherever they are, +20 Power until played.
    [TriggerTime:DRAW] [Effect:LOCK] [Target:THIS] [Duration:END_ROUND] &&
    [TriggerTime:PLAY] [Effect:POWER_FOR_EACH, Value:10, CountEach:[Who:BOTH, Where:PLAY_HISTORY, CompareTo:Awesome Aviation], UpTo:18] [Target:THIS] [Duration:END_TURN] &&
    [TriggerTime:RETURN] [Effect:POWER, Value:20] [Target:[Who:SELF, Where:CARDS_IN_DECK, CompareTo:Money; Money; Money]] [Duration:UNTIL_PLAYED]

(Alexander Hamilton) When drawn, if your deck contains at least 1 Stage & Screen or Musically Minded card, give your History cards +17 Power until played.
    [TriggerTime:DRAW] [Condition:DECK_CONTAINS, Find:[Who:SELF, Where:CARDS_IN_DECK, CompareTo:Stage & Screen OR Musically Minded]] [Target:[Who:SELF, Where:CARDS_IN_DECK, CompareTo:History]] [Effect:POWER, Value:20] [Duration:UNTIL_PLAYED]

(Luxor Temple) When returned to your deck, reduce the Energy cost of your Common History cards by 1 until played.
    [TriggerTime:RETURN] [Target:[Who:SELF, Where:CARDS_IN_DECK, CompareTo:History, Rarity:Common]] [Effect:ENERGY, Value:-1] [Duration:UNTIL_PLAYED]
