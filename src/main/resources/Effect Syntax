Individual effects are described by following syntax, so I can parse them.
Categories always have exactly one info, except Condition can have any amount.

Usable parameters in some cases are:
    Who       = SELF | OTHER | BOTH
    Where     = CARDS_IN_DECK | CARDS_IN_HAND | CARDS_REMAINING
    What      = ALBUM | COLLECTION | NAME | NAME_CONTAINS | RANDOM | THIS
    CompareTo = string to search
    Value     = int value (or string if options are specified)

TriggerTime:
    START_GAME
    START_ROUND
    START
    DRAW
    PLAY
    RETURN

Target:
    Who, [ Where, [ What, [ CompareTo ] ] ]             // If rest is omitted, Who = Player, Where = All those cards, What = Special cases RANDOM and THIS

Effect:
    ENERGY_PER_TURN (Value)
    POWER_PER_TURN (Value)
    ENERGY (Value)
    POWER (Value)
    BURN (Value)
    LOCK                                                // May not have the duration UNTIL_PLAYED
    POWER_FOR_EACH (Value, CountEach)                   // CountEach defines a full Target object

Duration:
    END_TURN
    END_ROUND
    TIMER (Value)
    PERMANENT
    UNTIL_PLAYED

Conditions:
    AFTER_ROUND (Value)
    BEFORE_ROUND (Value)
    PLAYED_WITH (Who, Where, What, CompareTo)
    PLAYED_BEFORE (Who, Where, What, CompareTo)
    ROUND_STATE (Value)                                 // Value = Win | EqWin | Equal | EqLoss | Loss
    TURN_STATE (Value)                                  // Value = Win | EqWin | Equal | EqLoss | Loss   NOTE: Only properly applicable on RETURN
    TURN_IN_ROUND (Value)
    ROUNDS_LOST (Value)                                 // Value can be precise number or number with > | >= | <= | <
    ROUNDS_WON (Value)                                  // Value can be precise number or number with > | >= | <= | <
    DECK_CONTAINS (Who, Where, What, CompareTo, Value)  // Value can be precise number or number with > | >= | <= | <
