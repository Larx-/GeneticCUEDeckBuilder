\chapter{Results and Evaluation}
\label{ch:results}
This part will show the results of the experiments, if possible graphically, and discuss what can be learned from them.

\section{Experimental result data}
\label{ch:results:data}
Tables and logs mostly. 

\section{Evaluating collected data}
\label{ch:results:eval}
Possibly some light play testing of the decks in the real game might be possible at this point, but an evaluation from one or better a few experienced players would be preferable.
