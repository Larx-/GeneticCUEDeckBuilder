	\chapter*{Abstract}
	In every CCG, like “Magic: The Gathering” or “Hearthstone”, an important part of the game is constructing your deck from a vast number
	of available cards. This kind of combinatorial optimization problem is almost impossible to solve exhaustively. That is why many
	solutions for AI deck building rely on evolutionary algorithms. In this thesis I develop a genetic deck builder for the game CUE. This
	CCG is fairly unique, because their game rules, like energy gain per turn, change every week. This offers an interesting aspect to test.
	Is it advantageous to keep evolving using the same decks over constantly changing game rules or is a fresh start for every rule change
	more successful?
